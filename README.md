# South Asian Heart Health & AI | Paper Explainer

An interactive web experience designed to explain the findings of the research paper **"Addressing myocardial infarction in South-Asian populations"**. This project visualizes why South Asians are at higher risk for heart attacks and how Artificial Intelligence is helping to close the diagnostic gap.

## 📖 About the Project

South Asians face a significantly higher mortality risk from Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack) compared to other populations. Traditional risk scores often underestimate this danger. This web application breaks down the complex medical and technical concepts from the research into an accessible, engaging format.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **The Silent Crisis:** Statistics highlighting the disproportionate impact on South Asians.
- **The Genetic Puzzle:** Explaining the "Thin-Fat" phenotype, Lipoprotein(a), and insulin resistance.
- **AI Deep Dive:** How Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers analyze ECGs to find hidden risk patterns.
- **Interactive Demo:** A visual comparison showing how AI-enhanced scores differ from traditional risk assessments.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI:** Smooth scroll animations and dynamic visual elements.
- **Educational Content:** Clear, concise explanations of medical and AI concepts.
- **Visual Demonstrations:** Neural network visualizations and risk score comparisons.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom styling, animations, and responsive layout (no frameworks).
- **JavaScript:** Scroll reveal effects and interactive elements.
